1. Pagination                   Done
2. Infinite Scrolling           Done
3. State Management             Bloc
4. Architecture                 Clean Architecture 
5. Error handling               Dedicated Error Mapper 
6. Retry Mechanism              Implemented
7. Navigation                   GoRouter

## Note : To reduce code clutter i have picked limited fields from api response but I made sure that data fields are complex (eg: nested list) and important. I give limited focus on developing pixel perfect UI rather focus on Clean Architecture, Readable, Maintainable and Reusable code with proper error handling
