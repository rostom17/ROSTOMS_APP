Assesssment by CifarX

## Getting Started

## api = "https://dummyjson.com/products"

## Features and Principles Implemented in this application:
1. Pagination                   
2. Infinite Scrolling           
3. State Management (Bloc)
4. Clean Architecture 
5. Proper Error Handling 
6. Retry Mechanism    
7. Navigation with GoRouter
8. Functional Programming (Dartz)  

## Note : 
To reduce code clutter, I selected a limited number of fields from the API response, ensuring that the chosen data fields are both important and include complex structures (e.g., nested lists). I focused less on creating a pixel-perfect UI and more on implementing clean architecture, readable, maintainable, and reusable code with proper error handling.
